# Valuation of volatility derivatives

**Gruenbichler and Longstaff (1996)** model (or GL (1996)) for valuation
of volatility derivatives is presented. This model assumes diffusion processes for the dynamics of the
underlying, and, based on the general approach of risk-neutral evaluation, simple closed-
form expressions for valuation of options and futures on volatility index are derived. In this paper
analysis of VSTOXX options has been done, and GL (1996) model has been calibrated to call options
on volatility index (VSTOXX) traded on 2014-03-31.
The paper is constructed as follows. **Section 1** presents basic concepts of option management.
**Section 2** describes **Gruenbichler and Longstaff (1996)** model. **Section 3** starts with application of
basic concepts discussed in **Section 1** for analysis of options on VSTOXX, at the end of this section
calibration of GL (1996) to the real data is presented. In **Section 5** main conclusions are briefly
represented.
